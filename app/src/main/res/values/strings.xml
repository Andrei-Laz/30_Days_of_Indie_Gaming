    <string name="description_game1">Eternal Senia is a free-to-play anime-style action RPG where players control a young girl named Senia who is searching for her adopted sister and demon hunter, Magaleta. The story follows Senia as she enters the Tower of Eternity to find Magaleta, who disappeared without a trace. Gameplay involves exploring the tower, fighting enemies in a fast-paced ARPG style (rather than traditional turn-based combat), and uncovering the sisters\' history through flashbacks.</string>
